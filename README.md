# Aquafall 2
The second generation of Aquafall.  
We're back, with a better codebase, better structure, and more computer. wait what?  
Yup. Back in style.  

## Using
We're not prod ready just yet, just a blank screen with some stuff going on behind the seemingly empty screen, but you can check out the latest commit [right here!](https://aquafall.github.io/v2/)

## Building from scratch
Pretty easy, clone, use your favourite Node package manager, I like yarn, install dependenices and run the build script. For example:  
`yarn`  
`yarn build`  
and we're built. Use `yarn run` for an in-browser developer version where edits are pushed immediately.  

## Can I help?
Of course! Create a PR and we'll review it asap.

## What will Aquafall have?
Hopefully 3rd party app support built right in, and not with tacky Iframes. Native apps that can integrate with our OS and improve your experience further than what we provide. Totally wicked permissions system that disallows Kitty Cat Sim 3D from accessing your files but allows that random jailbreaking app everyone uses to get more out of Aquafall and add funny transitions to their Settings app direct access to the kernel. We're open like that.
